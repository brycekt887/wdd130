        <p class="p1">to start lets look at the top three dog breeds</p>
        <div class = "grid3">
            <img class ="pic4" src ="images/frenchbuldog.jpg" alt="dog">
            <img class ="pic5" src ="images/Labador retriever.jpg" alt="dog">
            <img class ="pic6" src ="images/golden.webp" alt="dog">
            <div class="p2">
                <p>The French Bulldog has really captured hearts lately—it’s not hard to see why. Over the past decade, its registrations have soared by over 1,000%, and this tiny, compact dog fits perfectly into busy city life. They’re incredibly charming, with those distinctive bat-like ears and an easygoing nature. However, because of their flat faces, they sometimes struggle with breathing issues and need extra care in hot weather.</p>
            </div>
            <div class = "p3">
                <p>Although French Bulldogs are small in stature, their lively and playful personality never fails to entertain their owners. They're celebrated for their amusing antics and fondness for interactive play, which injects a burst of energy into any home. This spirited nature means they truly flourish with regular engagement and playtime, keeping them both happy and well-adjusted. Moreover, they develop strong, affectionate bonds with their human families—including children—and crave close, consistent contact, often seeking cuddles and constant companionship. As a result, while they adapt well to smaller living spaces, they may struggle if left alone for long periods without interaction.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class = "p4">
                <p>For over 30 years, the Labrador Retriever has been a household favorite, and it’s still a top pick for many families. Labs are famously friendly and get along well with kids, making them the perfect companion for outdoor adventures. They love swimming and playing fetch, but be prepared—labs are prone to overeating and, if not exercised properly, can develop joint problems and obesity.
            </div>
            <div class = "p5">
                <p>Labrador Retrievers are celebrated for their inexhaustible energy and zest for life. They flourish when given plenty of physical activity and need considerable daily exercise to remain joyful and in peak condition. Their naturally playful demeanor makes them perfect companions for active individuals and families who can offer ample opportunities for running, swimming, and playing. In addition, Labradors are exceptionally smart and eager to please, which makes training a breeze. They excel in a range of activities—from retrieving games and agility trials to water sports—and are often utilized as service or assistance dogs. Training methods that emphasize positive reinforcement, such as using treats, praise, and toys, work especially well with this breed.</p>
            </div>
            <div class = "p6">
                <p>Golden Retrievers are beloved for their gentle, loving temperament and unwavering loyalty. Bred originally for retrieving game, these cheerful dogs are full of energy and love to join in family fun, whether it’s hiking, playing in the park, or just cuddling on the couch. Their beautiful, thick coats do require regular grooming, and their shedding can be a bit of a commitment, so you’ll need to keep up with brushing and cleaning.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class = "p7">
                <p>In addition to their warmth, Golden Retrievers are remarkably smart and spirited, brimming with energy. They love playing fetch and engaging in activities that let them run and explore, which means they need plenty of daily exercise to stay physically fit and mentally sharp. Without ample outlets for their vigor, they might resort to destructive habits. Their playful demeanor and overall gentle temperament make them ideal companions for children of nearly all ages—even though their boundless enthusiasm can sometimes be a bit much for very young kids. Plus, their naturally sociable nature usually leads them to enjoy the company of other animals.
