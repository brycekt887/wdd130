                <p>
                  "I adopted my sweet tabby cat, Mochi, through Paws & Hearts Adoption last month, and the experience was fantastic! The website was easy to navigate, with filters for age, breed, and personality traits. I loved the detailed profiles—each pet had photos, videos, and even notes from foster parents. The adoption team responded quickly to my application and set up a virtual meet-and-greet. Mochi arrived healthy, microchipped, and with all her medical records. The only hiccup was a slight delay in shipping her favorite toy, but the team apologized and sent extra treats. Highly recommend!" — Sarah T., New York

                  "My family visited Furever Friends Rescue looking for a small dog, but ended up adopting a senior terrier named Buddy! The website’s ‘Seniors for Seniors’ program caught my mom’s eye—they waive fees for adopters over 60. Buddy’s profile mentioned he was calm, house-trained, and loved naps (perfect for my retired parents). The process was straightforward, though the online form was a bit lengthy. The rescue even offered a free vet checkup post-adoption. Buddy’s adjusted beautifully, and we’re so grateful for their focus on older pets. Half a star off only because the site could use a better mobile layout." — James L., Texas

                <p>
                  "I spent weeks browsing Happy Tails Adoption daily—their rotating ‘Pet of the Week’ feature kept me hooked! I finally found Luna, a shy husky mix, and applied immediately. The team was transparent about her anxiety history and connected me with her foster mom for a phone chat. They even sent a trial “foster-to-adopt” kit with food and a blanket to ease Luna’s transition. The adoption fee was higher than expected, but it covered spaying, vaccinations, and a training session. Luna’s now my adventure buddy, and the support group for adopters on their website is a lifesaver. 10/10!" — Priya R., California
